## Code Style

### General Principles
- **Simplicity over cleverness** - Code should be readable
- **Minimal dependencies** - Only add what's truly necessary
- **Document the why** - Comments explain reasoning, not mechanics

### Python Style
- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints where they add clarity
- Keep functions focused and small

### Commit Messages
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Reference issues when applicable

## Project Philosophy

When contributing, keep these principles in mind:

```
Path is Model. Storage is Inference. Glob is Query.
The filesystem is not storage. It is a circuit.
Restraint is not constraint. It is conscience.
```

- **Sovereignty first** - Everything runs locally
- **Transparency** - Actions should be auditable
- **Governance** - Power requires accountability
